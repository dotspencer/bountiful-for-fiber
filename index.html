      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="question">How will this be paid for?</div>
      <div class="answer">This will be paid for by the normal subscription fees of people who sign up for service once the fiber is run. There are no installation fees or sign-on fees like in other cities.  If after 5 years there isn't a 33% take rate, then the city would be responsible for the difference. This hasn't been an issue with the other cities UIA has worked with, please see the slideshow to see the very conservative estimate that was presented to the city.  Centerville has roughly a 50% take rate.  See Morgan city in the presentation as a great example of a very recent city that had fiber run.</div>

      <div class="question">Why would I want this?</div>
      <div class="answer">This will bring in at least 11 more ISPs to compete for your business. More choices are better for everyone, including people who choose to stay with their current provider.</div>

      <div class="question">Why run fiber to the home?</div>
      <div class="answer">This is the most future-proof way of meeting our current  and future needs. Fiber to the home provides faster, more secure, and cheaper service.
There are sections of the city that can barely get broadband speeds. This would provide service to every resident of Bountiful.</div>

      <div class="question">Does the city need to spend money or take out a bond?</div>
      <div class="answer">No, not if there are enough subscribers after a 5-year buildout period. Morgan had enough subscribers in less than a year.</div>

      <div class="question">Are there any other benefits from having fiber run throughout the city?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        <ul>
          <li>Average savings of $27/month</li>
          <li>3.1% average increased property values</li>
          <li>Many more are covered in the presentation and discussed in the FB group. Please join one of the groups!</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="question">How fast of a connection can I get?</div>
      <div class="answer">10,000 Mbps for homes is currently the top end, but that speed will continue to increase. 100,000 Mbps for businesses.</div>

      <div class="question">How much will&nbsp; this cost?</div>
      <div class="answer">That information can be found by <a href="https://www.utopiafiber.com/residential-pricing/">clicking here</a>.</div>

      <div class="question">Where can I get more information?</div>
      <div class="answer">Join our <a href="https://bit.ly/BountifulforFiberFB">Facebook group</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/BountifulforFiberNextdoor">Nextdoor group</a>, or <a href="https://bit.ly/BountifulforFiber">Email list</a> for information and updates.</div>
